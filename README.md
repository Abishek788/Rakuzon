# Cloud-Native E-Commerce Platform

An end-to-end e-commerce platform built on AWS, designed to support scalable, serverless operations with secure payment processing and a seamless user experience. This project leverages AWS services and Stripe integration to provide a robust solution for online retail.

## Overview

The platform enables users to browse, add items to the cart, and complete purchases with secure, fast transactions. The serverless backend uses AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to handle traffic with high scalability, and it integrates Stripe for secure payment processing.

## Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Fully serverless backend built with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.
- **Secure Payment Processing**: Integrated with Stripe for PCI-compliant transactions and rapid payment processing.
- **High Scalability**: Supports large volumes of concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Real-Time Order Management**: Dynamically updates inventory and order status.
- **Optimized Resource Usage**: Uses S3 lifecycle policies and reserved instances for cost-effectiveness.

### Key Components

1. **AWS Lambda**: Processes user requests, such as order creation and cart management.
2. **Amazon API Gateway**: Acts as the entry point, handling all API requests.
3. **Amazon DynamoDB**: Manages data for products, users, and orders, ensuring high availability and fast access times.
4. **Amazon S3**: Stores static assets, product images, and supports website hosting.
5. **AWS CloudFront**: Delivers content globally for low-latency user experiences.
6. **Stripe**: Processes secure, PCI-compliant payments, providing a seamless checkout experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: Necessary for deploying AWS resources.
- **Stripe Account**: Required for processing payments; obtain API keys from your Stripe dashboard.
- **AWS CLI**: To deploy and manage resources via command-line.

### Usage

1. **Browsing Products**: Users can browse available products by visiting the platformâ€™s homepage.
2. **Adding Items to Cart**: Items can be added to the cart, with real-time inventory management.
3. **Checkout and Payment**: Users can proceed to checkout, where Stripe handles secure payment processing.
4. **Order Confirmation**: Once payment is completed, users receive an order confirmation, and inventory is updated.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The platform uses CodePipeline for CI/CD, enabling automatic testing and deployment of new updates. The pipeline includes:

- **GitHub Integration**: For source control and version tracking.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Manages build and deployment stages.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Automates infrastructure provisioning for rapid scaling and management.

## Monitoring & Analytics

- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Logs API requests and monitors Lambda performance for operational insights.
- **AWS Kinesis (Optional)**: Enables advanced real-time analytics for customer interactions and order trends.
